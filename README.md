# grzegorz-aleksander.klementowski.pl

Personal portfolio site for Grzegorz Aleksander Klementowski (Management Information Systems focus) built with handcrafted HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project is a showcase of front-end engineering, interaction design, and narrative project storytelling without framework dependencies.

## Skill Focus
- Front-end engineering: semantic HTML5 structure, CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts, hero video background, gradient sections, and custom `@font-face` typography.
- Interaction design: custom typewriter effect, IntersectionObserver-driven reveal animations, and bespoke smooth-scrolling for both wheel and touch input (with Firefox fallbacks).
- Responsive design: orientation-based breakpoints, animated hamburger navigation, mobile-first grid reflow, and adaptive media sizing across `css/responsive.css`.
- Portfolio storytelling: dedicated project pages (`php-sql-project.html`, `google-serp-seo-comparison-tool.html`, `airtrails-sql-queries.html`, `games-projects.html`, `blockchain-apps.html`, `ai-apps.html`) combining feature breakdowns, skills lists, and screenshot galleries.
- UX polish and SEO: canonical/meta tags, favicon set, lightweight assets (`img/`, `vid/`, `icons/`), analytics hook, and accessible link/hit-area considerations.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: landing page with hero, project grid, competencies, and contact footer.
- `css/`: modular styling (`style.css`, `nav.css`, `header.css`, `main.css`, `animations.css`, `responsive.css`, `footer.css`, `pages.css`) separating layout, theming, motion, and page-specific rules.
- `javascript/script.js`: interaction layer covering typewriter text, scroll/touch navigation between sections, hamburger menu toggling, and reveal-on-scroll behavior.
- `fonts/`, `img/`, `icons/`, `vid/`: locally served assets and project imagery used across the site and subpages.
- Additional HTML pages: detailed write-ups for highlighted projects with language/stack notes and galleries tailored to each case study.

## UX and Visual Notes
- Cinematic entry with an autoplayed background video and delayed nav fade-in.
- Grid-based hero call-to-action, project cards with iconography, and animated section entrances to guide attention.
- Contact-first footer with clear social/email/phone routes to reinforce hireability.
